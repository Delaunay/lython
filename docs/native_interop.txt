C++ classes are decomposed into two parts

* Data
* functions


 struct Vector {                                        |
    float x;                                            |
    float y;                                            |
    float z;                                            |
                                                        |
    Vector operator+(Vector a) {                        |
        return Vector(x + a.x, y + a.y, z + a.z);       |
    }                                                   |
 }                                                      |


There might be two way to convert the native object to script

* metadata/reflection api
* create a classdef mirror 
    * this makes native appear quite seamless

file => Module => 
    struct => classdef
