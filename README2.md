Lython
======

Welcome to my journey of compiler rediscovery. This repo was historically based
upon the kaleidoscope tutorial (How to build a new language using LLVM).

Nevertheless, the project it not anymore linked to kaleidoscope.


Objective of the Project
========================

Build a new language from scracth.

We will start by building a basic math engine. With very few features.

We will use this base language to build a more advanced language.
